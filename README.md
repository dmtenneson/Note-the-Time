Note the Time
==============

This is the source repositor for the Pebble watchapp "Note the Time"

#Features
- Capture the current time and create a description regarding the significance of that time (thanks to tertiary text of Ricky Ayoub: https://github.com/vgmoose/tertiary_text)
- Create flexible alarm for captured time at either specific time (AM/PM) or "time from now" format (thanks to alarm management inspiration from  Alarm++ by Christian Reinbacher  https://github.com/reini1305/alarmsplusplus)
- Manage saved times (edit note/edit alarm/delete)
